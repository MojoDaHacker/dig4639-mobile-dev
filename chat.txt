Hey,

You should have a request to share a terminal.

I dont see it

In the live share tab, there should be an option to right cilck 
the shared terminal and share it. The one that says "node (Read-only)"

I right clicked it and it only say focuse on terminal

Ok, one sec.

Create a new terminal, and I'll request access
Just Terminal > New Terminal or the plus next to it.

I clicked terminal > New Terminal 

It made a new Terminal

Let me rejoin then.

Only one terminal is showing up for me, did you create it in this window?

Let me try again.

Here's a 

It's just creating zsh terminals, I can make a new liveshare and set terminal to write
cause right now it o
nly

OR I can help via Zoom screen share, but that would be worth trying. 

Yea we can do a zoom call
